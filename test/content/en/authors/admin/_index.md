## About Me

Hi, I'm Wenbo Han from China. I’m interested in computer architecture and operating systems, parallel programming, verification of parallel algorithms, programs, and hardware. Currently, I am participating in the YSYX project. You can click on **Study Notes** to read some of my notes, which include content related to mathematics and computer science. Feel free to reach out to me via email.
